                For a thousand years ashes have fallen from the sky. For a
                thousand years nothing has flourished. For a thousand years the
                skaa have been enslaved and live in misery, mired in inevitable
                fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler has reigned with
                absolute power, ruling thanks to terror, his powers and his
                immortality, aided by "benders" and "inquisitors", along with
                the powerful magic of Allomancy.
